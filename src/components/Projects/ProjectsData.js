      description: "Developed a Terminal Task Manager application using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The application allows users to easily add, edit, and remove tasks through a simple, user-friendly terminal interface. By leveraging JavaScript's object-oriented principles, I created a task management system where each task is represented as an object, ensuring efficient handling and manipulation of tasks. The app is designed to provide clear feedback to users, showing confirmation messages when tasks are successfully added, edited, or deleted. The core goal was to offer a smooth and intuitive user experience while interacting with the terminal, making task management simple and efficient",
